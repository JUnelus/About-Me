Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

Hello everyone, my name is Jimmy. I graduated from CUNY over a decade ago with a degree in Chemistry and a minor in Math. I worked at BNYMellon for 13 years as a lead analyst in their conversion/client on-boarding team. I've always had a love for tech and dabbling with coding like JavaScript and HTML. I strongly believe the future of finance is in FinTech and I'm looking forward to this bootcamp.
